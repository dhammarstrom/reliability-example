## Introduction

Introducing isokinetic strength testing.


## Methods

How did we do the test.



```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

reliability_data <- read_excel("data/reliability-data.xlsx") %>%
  mutate(diff = trial2 - trial1) %>%
  
  summarise(s = sd(diff),
            te = s / sqrt(2), 
            m = mean(c(trial1, trial2)), 
            cv = (te / m) * 100) 

cv <- round(reliability_data$cv, 2)
```

## Results and discussion

The typical error of the test was `r cv`%.

This means that if ...
